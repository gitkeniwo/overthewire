Congratulations on your first steps into the bandit game!!
Please make sure you have read the rules at https://overthewire.org/rules/
If you are following a course, workshop, walkthrough or other educational activity,
please inform the instructor about the rules as well and encourage them to
contribute to the OverTheWire community so we can keep these games free!

The password you are looking for is: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

## L2
ok this one is trick. So basically if your filename is just a hyphen `-`, you use double hyphen to escape it (mark the end of flags and options), as in `vim -- -` or `cat ./-`. However, somehow `cat -- -` didn't work for me.

```
## L6 `find  your/path/ -type f -exec COMMAND {} +`
The simplest way to output all pipeline-able filenames plus their paths, is `find .`

> [!tip]
> `file` does not read from standard input, so it is recommend to use `file your/path/ -type f -exec COMMAND {} +`
> where `-type f` specifies we are looking for files, `{}` is a placeholder for the filenames found by `find`, and `+` tells find to pass as many filenames as possible to file in a single invocation, which is more efficient than running file separately for each file.
> See 

       -exec command ;
              Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until  an  argu‐
              ment  consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the
              arguments to the command, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both of these constructions  might  need
              to  be  escaped  (with a `\') or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES section for examples of the use of
              the -exec option.  The specified command is run once for each matched file.  The command is executed in the  starting  directory.   There
              are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of the -exec action; you should use the -execdir option instead.

       -exec command {} +
              This  variant  of  the -exec action runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command line is built by appending each se‐
              lected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of the command will be much less than the number of matched files.  The com‐
              mand line is built in much the same way that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed  within  the  command,
              and  it  must appear at the end, immediately before the `+'; it needs to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect it from interpreta‐
              tion by the shell.  The command is executed in the starting directory.  If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero  value  as
              exit  status, then find returns a non-zero exit status.  If find encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some
              pending commands may not be run at all.  For this reason -exec my-command ... {} + -quit may not result in my-command actually being run.
              This variant of -exec always returns true.

```sh
bandit5@bandit:~$ find . -type f -exec ls -alt  {} + | grep 1033
-rw-r----- 1 root bandit5 1033 Sep 19 07:08 ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
```

## L7

```sh
find . -type f -exec ls -alt {} + 2>/dev/null | grep bandit7 | grep bandit6
-rw-r----- 1 bandit7 bandit6      33 Sep 19 07:08 ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

Explanation:
- `find . -type f -exec ls -alt {} +` is just the same as L6.
- `2>/dev/null` redirects stderr to /dev/null so that we don't see a lot of 'permission denied' messages like `find: ‘./run/lock/lvm’: Permission denied`
- grep lines with both `bandit7` and `bandit6`. Can just chain two grep commands to match two words that are not necessarily next to each other.

uniq

Output the unique lines from a input or file.
Since it does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent, we need to sort them first.
More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/uniq>.

- Display each line once:
    sort path/to/file | uniq

- Display only unique lines:
    sort path/to/file | uniq -u

- Display only duplicate lines:
    sort path/to/file | uniq -d

- Display number of occurrences of each line along with that line:
    sort path/to/file | uniq -c

- Display number of occurrences of each line, sorted by the most frequent:
    sort path/to/file | uniq -c | sort -nr

⚠️ Take notice of `-p` flag with `xxd`. If you just want to revert it, use only `-r` as `-p` will add 4 extra hex digits.
```sh
# Wrongly used -p flag
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.n2pYbOTEI5$ xxd -r -p data.txt output
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.n2pYbOTEI5$ xxd -l 16 -g 1 output.gz 
# -l: Display output only up to a length of 16 bytes; -g: Separate the output of every <bytes> bytes

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.n2pYbOTEI5$ gunzip output.gz
gzip: output.gz: not in gzip format

# Correct

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.n2pYbOTEI5$ xxd -l 16 -g 1 output

output: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 3154116610
```
In this case, `.gz` (gzip file)'s magic number is `1f 8b`. 
In the first try, `-p` actually prepended four `00` to the output, causing `gunzip` to not work.

> **Compression**

Reference:
```
-c      Create a new archive containing the specified items.  The long option form is --create.
-f file, --file file
        Read the archive from or write the archive to the specified file.  The filename can be - for standard input or standard output.  The default
        varies by system; on FreeBSD, the default is /dev/sa0; on Linux, the default is /dev/st0.
-v, --verbose
        Produce verbose output.  In create and extract modes, tar will list each file name as it is read from or written to the archive.  In list mode,
        tar will produce output similar to that of ls(1).  An additional -v option will also provide ls-like details in create and extract mode.
-x      Extract to disk from the archive.  If a file with the same name appears more than once in the archive, each copy will be extracted, with later
        copies overwriting (replacing) earlier copies.  The long option form is --extract.
-z, --gunzip, --gzip
        (c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with gzip(1).  In extract or list modes, this option is ignored.  Note that this tar implementation
        recognizes gzip compression automatically when reading archives.
```

After reverting hexdump with `xxd -r`, it is a bunch of very painful decompression and unarchiving with `bzip2 -d`, `gunzip -v`, and `tar xvf`.

After finishing Lv 16, i realized that this level essentially requires a TCP transport-layer connection.
So `nc` is also viable.

This level is about the usage of `openssl s_client`. To refer to its man page, the command is `man openssl-s_client`.

tldr:
```
openssl s_client

OpenSSL command to create TLS client connections.
More information: <https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-s_client.html>.

- Display the start and expiry dates for a domain's certificate:
    openssl s_client -connect host:port 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

- Display the certificate presented by an SSL/TLS server:
    openssl s_client -connect host:port </dev/null

- Set the Server Name Indicator (SNI) when connecting to the SSL/TLS server:
    openssl s_client -connect host:port -servername hostname

- Display the complete certificate chain of an HTTPS server:
    openssl s_client -connect host:443 -showcerts </dev/null
```

🧐 My personal thoughts on this level: https://samizdat.fly.dev/m/ABnfi5QTS6QxQkFCTWfZ5A

## L17 Port Scanning

`nmap <ip>` carries out a basic port scanning process.

> [!important]
> `nmap <ip>` by default does not do a full scan. It only scans the most well-known hosts, and ports that aren't on that list are omitted.
> 
> To do a full scan, use `nmap -p 1-65535` or `nmap -p-`. [source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/238640/nmap-doesnt-appear-to-list-all-open-ports)

It is also adviced to enable `service detection` with `-sv`
```
SERVICE AND VERSION DETECTION
       Point Nmap at a remote machine and it might tell you that ports 25/tcp, 80/tcp, and 53/udp are open. Using its nmap-services database of about 2,200 well-known services,
       Nmap would report that those ports probably correspond to a mail server (SMTP), web server (HTTP), and name server (DNS) respectively. This lookup is usually accurate—the
       vast majority of daemons listening on TCP port 25 are, in fact, mail servers. However, you should not bet your security on this! People can and do run services on strange
       ports.

       Even if Nmap is right, and the hypothetical server above is running SMTP, HTTP, and DNS servers, that is not a lot of information. When doing vulnerability assessments
       (or even simple network inventories) of your companies or clients, you really want to know which mail and DNS servers and versions are running. Having an accurate version
       number helps dramatically in determining which exploits a server is vulnerable to. Version detection helps you obtain this information.

       After TCP and/or UDP ports are discovered using one of the other scan methods, version detection interrogates those ports to determine more about what is actually
       running. The nmap-service-probes database contains probes for querying various services and match expressions to recognize and parse responses. Nmap tries to determine
       the service protocol (e.g. FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP), the application name (e.g. ISC BIND, Apache httpd, Solaris telnetd), the version number, hostname, device type (e.g.
       printer, router), the OS family (e.g. Windows, Linux). When possible, Nmap also gets the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) representation of this information. Sometimes
       miscellaneous details like whether an X server is open to connections, the SSH protocol version, or the KaZaA user name, are available. Of course, most services don't
provide all of this information. If Nmap was compiled with OpenSSL support, it will connect to SSL servers to deduce the service listening behind that encryption layer.
       Some UDP ports are left in the open|filtered state after a UDP port scan is unable to determine whether the port is open or filtered. Version detection will try to elicit
       a response from these ports (just as it does with open ports), and change the state to open if it succeeds.  open|filtered TCP ports are treated the same way. Note that
       the Nmap -A option enables version detection among other things.  A paper documenting the workings, usage, and customization of version detection is available at
       https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html.

       When RPC services are discovered, the Nmap RPC grinder is automatically used to determine the RPC program and version numbers. It takes all the TCP/UDP ports detected as
       RPC and floods them with SunRPC program NULL commands in an attempt to determine whether they are RPC ports, and if so, what program and version number they serve up.
       Thus you can effectively obtain the same info as rpcinfo -p even if the target's portmapper is behind a firewall (or protected by TCP wrappers). Decoys do not currently
       work with RPC scan.

       When Nmap receives responses from a service but cannot match them to its database, it prints out a special fingerprint and a URL for you to submit it to if you know for
       sure what is running on the port. Please take a couple minutes to make the submission so that your find can benefit everyone. Thanks to these submissions, Nmap has about
       6,500 pattern matches for more than 650 protocols such as SMTP, FTP, HTTP, etc.

       Version detection is enabled and controlled with the following options:

       -sV (Version detection)
           Enables version detection, as discussed above. Alternatively, you can use -A, which enables version detection among other things.

        -sR is an alias for -sV. Prior to March 2011, it was used to active the RPC grinder separately from version detection, but now these options are always combined.
```

So, we would say 31790 is the one. But when we tried submitting the code to 31790, strange stuff happened.

⚠️ The server shouted KEYUPDATE.

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
...TLS messages
...
---
read R BLOCK
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
KEYUPDATE
```

This is probably due to the CONNECTED COMMANDS.

Below is an excerpt from the man page of openssl-s_client
```
CONNECTED COMMANDS
       If a connection is established with an SSL server then any data received from the server is displayed and any key presses will be
       sent  to  the  server.  If  end  of file is reached then the connection will be closed down. When used interactively (which means
       neither -quiet nor -ign_eof have been given), then certain commands are also recognized which perform special  operations.  These
       commands are a letter which must appear at the start of a line. They are listed below.

       Q   End the current SSL connection and exit.

       R   Renegotiate the SSL session (TLSv1.2 and below only).

       k   Send a key update message to the server (TLSv1.3 only)

       K   Send a key update message to the server and request one back (TLSv1.3 only)
```

What we gotta do is to escape `k`, or starting `s_client` with `-ign_eof`.

After some tests, `\k` really didn't worked out for me. So i used `openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -ign_eof`.

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -ign_eof
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

## L20 setuid

reading material: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid

> [!TIP]
> **补充知识：File Mode & setuid**
> 
> Unix file mode 的数值形式(numeric  representation)是一个八进制的四位数(a four-digit octal number)，其中常见的三个位是后三位，也就是我们熟悉的`rwx`。
> 
> 文件的不同权限叫**mode bits**, 因为mode bits的值仅有4, 2, 1，每个digit的数值表示=各个bit的加和，一般只有4567这些值。4=read bits, 5=`r-x`, 7=`rwx`. 我们常见的让脚本可执行的命令，就是`chmod 755`.
> 
> 当然除了数值也有symbolic representation，在chmod里更改mode的符号格式为`[u/g/o][+/-/=][modebit]`，具体含义可以自行查阅man page。
>
> **setuid & setgid bits**
> 
> 被我们忽略掉的四位数的第一位就是s位。其中4=setuid bit, 2=setgid bit, 1=sticky bit. 那么6711 = 6(4:`setuid` + 2:`setgid`) + 711(`rwx--x--x`)

Below is an excerpt from `man chmod`
```
MODES
     Modes may be absolute or symbolic.  An absolute mode is an octal number constructed from the sum of one or more of the following
     values:

           4000    (the setuid bit).  Executable files with this bit set will run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner.
                   Directories with this bit set will force all files and sub-directories created in them to be owned by the directory
                   owner and not by the uid of the creating process, if the underlying file system supports this feature: see chmod(2)
                   and the suiddir option to mount(8).
           2000    (the setgid bit).  Executable files with this bit set will run with effective gid set to the gid of the file owner.
           1000    (the sticky bit).  See chmod(2) and sticky(7).
           0400    Allow read by owner.
           0200    Allow write by owner.
           0100    For files, allow execution by owner.  For directories, allow the owner to search in the directory.
           0040    Allow read by group members.
           0020    Allow write by group members.
           0010    For files, allow execution by group members.  For directories, allow group members to search in the directory.
           0004    Allow read by others.
           0002    Allow write by others.
           0001    For files, allow execution by others.  For directories allow others to search in the directory.

    (...)

     The op symbols represent the operation performed, as follows:

     +     If no value is supplied for perm, the ``+'' operation has no effect.  If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
           specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set.  Otherwise,
           the mode bits represented by the specified who and perm values are set.

     -     If no value is supplied for perm, the ``-'' operation has no effect.  If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
           specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask is set, is cleared.  Otherwise, the mode
           bits represented by the specified who and perm values are cleared.

     =     The mode bits specified by the who value are cleared, or, if no who value is specified, the owner, group and other mode bits
           are cleared.  Then, if no value is supplied for who, each permission bit specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in
           the file mode creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set.  Otherwise, the mode bits represented by the specified who and
           perm values are set.

    (...)

EXAMPLES OF VALID MODES
     644           make a file readable by anyone and writable by the owner only.

     go-w          deny write permission to group and others.

     =rw,+X        set the read and write permissions to the usual defaults, but retain any execute permissions that are currently set.

     +X            make a directory or file searchable/executable by everyone if it is already searchable/executable by anyone.

     755
     u=rwx,go=rx
     u=rwx,go=u-w  make a file readable/executable by everyone and writable by the owner only.

     go=           clear all mode bits for group and others.

     g=u-w         set the group bits equal to the user bits, but clear the group write bit.  
```

Our solution:

Let's see how this binary works. `bandit20-do` is owned by `bandit20` and belongs to group `bandit19`, and can represent bandit20 to run our command under group `bandit19`.
Group `bandit19` means that any user that belongs to group `bandit19` (in this case, perhaps just the user `bandit19`) can do what the group has permission to do.

`s` means that when executing, `bandit20-do` has the same permission as the user `bandit20` 
and `x` in the group digit means that `bandit20-do` can be executed in group `bandit19`, and therefore user `bandit19`.
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -alt bandit*
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 14880 Sep 19 07:08 bandit20-do
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```

If we try printing out the credential directly, it turns out to be forbidden, as it is only readable by its owner bandit20. But using bandit20-do as a workaround we can bypass the permission wall. 
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
cat: /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20: Permission denied
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -alt /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
-r-------- 1 bandit20 bandit20 33 Sep 19 07:07 /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

## L21 netcat TCP Listener
This one actually took me some time. 
At first I thought is about Access Control and file modes again, 
so it really baffled me when starting from the executable and having no clue what is going on.

Let's see what is happening locally first. I use nmap to identify what service is running on 2220 localhost (ssh).
```
bandit20@bandit:~$ nmap -sV -p 2220 localhost
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-06 00:38 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00010s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
2220/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 9.6p1 (protocol 2.0)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.46 seconds

bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 2220
Read: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1
ERROR: This doesn't match the current password!

bandit20@bandit:~$ nc localhost 2220
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1
```

When I use `nc nc localhost 2220` to connect to port 2220, the ssh server prints `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1` which is just **the SSH server's initial greeting message**,
so `./suconnect 2220` actually connects to `bandit20@localhost:2220`, reads the first line and see if this line matches.

And as far as I can tell, `./suconnect` cannot connect to another username (we're gonna be stuck with bandit20)
So, the problem here is for suconnect to match. We'll in this case create our own network daemon. 

The perfect way to do this is to use netcat `nc` again. `nc` implements TCP and can of course initialize a TCP listener on `bandit20@localhost:SOMEPORT`.
We echo the password for Lv.20 and pass it for `nc -l` to serve it on port 2223 with a listener `-l`.
`&` is for detach mode so `nc` gives back our shell control.

```
bandit20@bandit:~$ echo "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | nc -l -p 2223 &
[2] 248374

bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 2223
